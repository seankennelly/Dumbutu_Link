              The Woodbury Salterton Dumbutu Link (WSDL) is dedicated to improving educational access and resources in Dumbutu. WSDL's sponsorship program covers essential school supplies, including uniforms, shoes, exercise books, pencils, and a
              daily allowance for lunch or snacks, helping keep children nourished and focused throughout the school day. The provision of uniforms also fosters a sense of equality and belonging among students, making school a more welcoming
              environment.

              Since 2010, WSDL has been a central supporter of the Dumbutu Women's Garden, an initiative that empowers 135 local women through sustainable agriculture. WSDL initially funded training in horticultural practices and organizational
              skills, partnering with the Bicton Overseas Agricultural Trust (BOAT) to help women gain essential farming knowledge. In 2011, WSDL funded the installation of protective fencing around the garden to safeguard crops from animals, and in
              2012, provided support for further training, transporting instructors from Banjul. In recent years, additional support from other organizations introduced irrigation to the garden, ensuring consistent crop production even in the dry
              season. With WSDL's foundational support and training, the Women's Garden has become a reliable food source and income generator, enhancing food security, nutrition, and economic independence for Dumbutu's women and their families.

            <p class="description">
              The recent development of a health centre in Dumbutu has greatly benefited the community. WSDL has supported this initiative by providing basic medical supplies and equipment, contributing to improved quality of care. Separately, a
              Manchester-based charity funded the installation of a borehole to supply clean water, and the diaspora community has supported the construction of a perimeter fence to secure the facility. These independent contributions complement
              WSDL's involvement, helping create a safer and more accessible healthcare environment for Dumbutu.

            <h2>Women's Garden and Sustainable Agriculture</h2>
            <p class="description">
              Since 2010, WSDL has been a central supporter of the Dumbutu Women's Garden, an initiative that empowers 135 local women through sustainable agriculture. WSDL initially funded training in horticultural practices and organizational
              skills, partnering with the Bicton Overseas Agricultural Trust (BOAT) to help women gain essential farming knowledge. In 2011, WSDL funded the installation of protective fencing around the garden to safeguard crops from animals, and in
              2012, provided support for further training, transporting instructors from Banjul.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              In recent years, additional support from other organizations introduced irrigation to the garden, ensuring consistent crop production even in the dry season. With WSDL's foundational support and training, the Women's Garden has become a
              reliable food source and income generator, enhancing food security, nutrition, and economic independence for Dumbutu's women and their families.
