            <h2>Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
            <p>
              Over recent years, several key improvements have been made to cleanliness, water access, and sanitation in Dumbutu, significantly enhancing the community's health and wellbeing. A new handwashing station was installed near the school
              and key community areas, providing easy access to clean water for regular handwashing, which has helped reduce the spread of illnesses, particularly among schoolchildren. The station includes a durable tap system, ensuring reliable
              water flow and maintenance through local resources. Alongside this, a toilet block was constructed to address previous gaps in sanitation facilities, offering separate, private cubicles for boys and girls. These new facilities not only
              provide a cleaner and safer environment but also help educate the younger generation about the importance of hygiene. Collectively, these projects, funded through the ongoing partnership with the Woodbury Salterton Dumbutu Link, have
              brought lasting improvements to the village's sanitation infrastructure and overall quality of life.

              better medical supplies and basic equipment, allowing healthcare workers to provide more effective treatment for common illnesses and emergencies. A clean water supply was also introduced, ensuring better hygiene and reducing the risk
              of infections within the facility. Additionally, the refurbishment of the building itself has created a cleaner, more welcoming environment for patients. These improvements have had a profound impact, making healthcare more accessible
              and reliable for the village, and playing a vital role in promoting overall community health.

            <h2>Women's Garden</h2>
            <p>
              Since 2010, we have supported the development of a communal garden benefiting 135 women residents in Dumbutu. This initiative involved funding training in vegetable cultivation and organizational skills, delivered by Concern Universal,
              a Berkshire-based charity. The project began in 2010/2011, when an area on the outskirts of the village was cultivated by the women of Dumbutu to grow vegetables for local consumption, with the potential to sell surplus produce. In
              2011, we funded the construction of half a kilometre of fencing around the garden to protect the crops from wild animals. The following year, in 2012, we provided additional support to train 123 women in horticulture. This training
              required daily transportation of instructors from Banjul to Dumbutu. The project has been highly successful. The garden comprises 756 small beds, with each woman allocated three beds situated in different areas of the garden, ensuring
              fairness in the distribution of resources.
            </p>
            <p>
              The women's garden in Dumbutu has undergone significant improvements, boosting both the productivity and sustainability of this vital community resource. With support from the Woodbury Salterton Dumbutu Link, a water supply system was
              introduced, allowing for consistent irrigation throughout the year, even during the dry season. This has greatly increased crop yields, providing more food for the village and improving local nutrition. The garden's layout was also
              improved, with designated plots for different crops, and training was provided to the women on better farming techniques, which has empowered them to manage the garden more efficiently. These developments have not only enhanced food
              security but have also provided the women with increased income opportunities, strengthening their role within the community and contributing to the overall economic and social wellbeing of Dumbutu.
